# Challenge Title
code challenge 15: trees<br>

## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency
1. i create tnode class <br>
2. i create a tree class with some method to traverse the tree <br>
like in order,pre order, post order<br>
3. and i create a binary tree class that will set the smallest values on the left always and biggest on the right <br>
big O :<br>
for tree class O(n) <br>
for the binary search class O(n) <br>
space :<br>
to tree class O(n) <br>
to the binary search class O(1)<br>


## Solution
python treess.py<br>
test----->pytest<br>
