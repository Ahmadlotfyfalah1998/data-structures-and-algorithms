## Approach & Efficiency
enqueue <br>
we create an animal class with two property name and species<br>
we create animal shelter class<br>
we create two queue first one is for cats and second is for dogs<br>
we create a an enqueue method that take an animal as parameter and will check if its have species = cat it will enqueue it to the cat queue and if species = dog it will enqueue it to the dog queue<br>
dequeue<br>
after enqueue the animals we  will dequeue them according to the pref<br>
if the pref equal cat it will dequeue a cat from the cats queue<br>
if the pref equal dog it will dequeue a dog from the dogs queue<br>
