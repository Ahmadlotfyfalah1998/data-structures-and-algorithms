# Challenge Title
code challenge 31

## Whiteboard Process
![Alt text](<code 31.jpg>)

## Approach & Efficiency
- the function called repeated_word and it take a string and return a firs repeated word in that string
- first we import regex and we check for all words in the string
- we loop over the string and set each word in the hash table
- then we check for each word if it in the hash table and when we find it we will return the  word
- big o :o(n)

- space complexity :o(n)
## Solution
python hash_repeted/hash.py
