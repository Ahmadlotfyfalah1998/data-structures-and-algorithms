code challenge 32

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
- the  function called tree_intersection and it take a two trees and return a list
- first it will traverse both trees using pre_order
- then it will create a hash table and it will loop over first tree element and it will set all the element in the hash table
- then it will loop over the second tree element and it will check for the element if it inside the hash table
- if it exist it will append the element in a list
- then it will return the list

## Solution
python trees.py
