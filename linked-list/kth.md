 Class 07
## Whiteboard Process
![Alt text](code%207.jpg)
## Approach & Efficiency
the function have a while loop to find the linked list length<br>
the function have another while loop to loop from start of the linked list<br>
the equation is (index = length -parameter -1 ) and its will loop until its find the index<br>
the function will return the index of parameter from the end of linked list<br>
Efficiency:<br>
big O:O(n)<br>
space:<br>
n(1)
## Solution
 python linked-list/linked_list.py
## tests
 pytest
