## Approach & Efficiency
insert :
the function will create a new node
the function will give he new node next of current node
the function will set the new node as a head
big O:O(1)
include :
the function will start from head
the function will loop over a linked list using while loop
if it find a value it will return true
if a nude become None and the value not founded  it will return false
big O:O(n)
## Solution
 python linked-list/linked_list.py
## tests
 pytest
